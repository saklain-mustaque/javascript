// Numeric conversion, unary +

// The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form and the unary form.

// The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesnâ€™t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
console.log(+true); // 1

let age = 24
if (!age >= 14 && age <= 90){
    console.log("True, the age is between 14 and 90")
